What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge is where new commits/changes that have been made on a separate "feature" branch are incorporated back into a "main" branch.

A rebase is where commits/changes are removed from one branch and added to another branch.

So the rebase removes the commits from the "feature" branch into the target branch, whereas a merge
just incorporates the changes from the feature branch into the target branch (moving vs. combining).

This is the main branch. Merge conflict?
